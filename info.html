        <h3>Summary of the situation

The recent rise in the spread of Zika virus in Brazil has been accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the number of children being born with unusually small heads—identified as microcephaly. In addition, several countries, including Brazil, reported a steep increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome—a neurological disorder that could lead to paralysis and death. Based on research, there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome.</h3>-->

        					<p>Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which also transmits chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever. Zika virus can also be transmitted through sex.

Zika virus has been detected in blood, urine, amniotic fluids, semen, saliva as well as body fluids found in the brain and spinal cord.</p>

                            <p>Zika virus usually causes mild illness. Symptoms most commonly include a slight fever or rash, appearing a few days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Although many will not develop any symptoms at all, others may also suffer from conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, and feel tired. The symptoms usually last from 2 to 7 days.

There is no known difference in the symptoms of infected pregnant and non-pregnant women.</p>

                            <p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms and the person’s recent history (e.g. mosquito bites, or travel to an area where Zika virus occurs). Laboratory testing can confirm the presence of Zika virus in the blood. However, this diagnosis may not be reliable as the virus could cross-react with other viruses such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever. A reliable, rapid point-of-care diagnostic test is a research and development priority.</p>

        				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        					<p>The best protection from Zika virus is preventing mosquito bites. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and their sexual partners should take extra care to protect themselves from the bites of the mosquito that transmits Zika. This can be done by:

Wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible.

Using insect repellent: repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing, and should contain DEET (diethyltoluamide) or IR 3535 or Icaridin which are the most common biologically active ingredients in insect repellents. Repellents must be used in strict accordance with the label instructions. They are safe for use by pregnant women.

Using physical barriers such mesh screens or treated netting materials on doors and windows.

Sleeping under mosquito nets, especially when resting during the day, when Aedes mosquitoes are most active.

Identifying and eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites, by emptying, cleaning or covering containers that can hold even small amounts of water, such as buckets, flower pots and tyres.</p>

        				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        					<p>Pregnant women living in areas of Zika virus transmission should follow the same prevention guidelines as the general population.

Pregnant women living in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should attend their regular antenatal care visits in accordance with national standards and comply with the recommendations of their health-care providers. They should also start antenatal care visits early for diagnosis and appropriate care and follow-up if they develop any of the Zika symptoms or signs.</p>

        				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What role does mosquito surveillance play in addressing Zika virus?</a>
        				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        					<p>Monitoring the numbers and location (surveillance) of mosquitos is used for operational and research purposes. It helps to determine changes in geographical distribution of mosquitos, for monitoring and evaluating control programmes, for measuring mosquito populations over time, and for facilitating appropriate and timely decisions regarding interventions.

Surveillance can serve to identify areas where a high-density infestation of mosquitos has occurred or periods when mosquito populations increase. In areas where the mosquitos are no longer present, mosquito surveillance is critical in order to detect new introductions rapidly before they become widespread and difficult to eliminate. Monitoring of the mosquito population’s susceptibility to insecticide should also be an integral part of any programme that uses insecticides. Surveillance is a critical component of prevention and control programme as it provides the information necessary for risk assessment, epidemic response and programme evaluation.

Surveillance programs in use for Aedes aegypti mosquitos do not involve collecting thousands of mosquitoes to test them all for the Zika virus. This would be extremely difficult to do considering the huge number of mosquitoes in the environment and the actual very low rate of Zika infection, even in an epidemic. For example, published reports suggest that less than 1 mosquito is infected with Zika for every 1000 mosquitoes.</p>

        				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        					<p>In Brazil, surveillance tests involving 1000 mosquitoes found that only 3 were infected with the Zika virus. This is a typical rate of infection found in what is commonly described as an epidemic situation.

Similarly, during a dengue epidemic in a South-American region that had affected more than 10% of the population, the infection rate for dengue in the Aedes aegypti was about 1 for every 1500.

These rates are quite typical, even in an epidemic.</p>

        				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why are we focusing on the Aedes mosquito as the primary vector for Zika? Is enough known to warrant the current design of the vector control program?</a>
        				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        					<p>All studies conducted to-date in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas support the conclusion that Aedes aegypti is the main vector and a mosquito in the same family, Aedes albopictus, has the potential for transmission of Zika virus. These 2 species of Aedes account for more than 90% of the bites received by a person during the daytime in the infected area. Both species breed and live near or inside human dwellings, preferring to bite humans over other animal hosts, and extensive documentation has shown their competency in transmitting the Zika virus. They are also known vectors of the other Flaviviruses such as dengue.

The current vector control recommendations targeting the Aedes species are also very efficient against other mosquito vectors and diseases. The range of methods for reducing mosquitos include spraying the inside walls of houses, indoor space spraying, larval control, and eliminating breeding sites. Mosquito control is recommended along side personal protection steps such as the use of insect repellents, bed nets, window and door netting, and wire mesh screens.</p>

                        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is it possible that another species of mosquito, the Culex for example, could be involved in the Zika virus epidemic?</a>
                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>There is no current evidence that the Culex species of mosquito is able to transmit the Zika virus. Culex quinquefasciastus mainly bite at night, and thus people sleeping under mosquito nets would be protected against Zika virus if Culex were the main transmitter. In Brazil, pregnant women are used to sleeping under mosquito nets, in particular in those states affected by malaria. From the epidemiology of the Zika virus, it appears that Zika virus is circulating in malarious areas where mosquito nets are currently being used.

To further strengthen our knowledge on the vectors of Zika virus, some research institutions such as Fiocruz in Brazil and Pasteur Institute in Paris are currently testing other mosquito species such as Culex for their potential competency for Zika virus./p>

Pregnant women should be advised not to travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks.

Pregnant women’s sex partners, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should practice safer sex or abstain for at least the duration of the pregnancy.

Couples or women planning a pregnancy, living in or returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, are strongly recommended to wait at least 8 weeks before trying to conceive; and 6 months if the male partner was symptomatic.

Men and women returning from an area where Zika is circulating should practice safer sex, including through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstain from sex for at least 8 weeks. If men experience symptoms (rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia or conjunctivitis) then they should adopt safer sexual practices or consider abstaining for at least 6 months.

Men and women of reproductive age, living in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should consider delaying pregnancy and follow recommendations (including the consistent use of condoms) to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and unwanted pregnancies.

                            <p> Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her nerves. People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adult men. Most people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In 20%-25% of people with the condition, the chest muscles are affected, making it hard to breathe. Severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome are rare, but can result in paralysis.</p>

                            <p>Microcephaly is a condition where a baby’s head is smaller than those of other babies of the same age and sex. Microcephaly happens when there is either a problem in utero, causing the baby’s brain to stop growing properly, or after birth when the head stops growing properly. Children born with microcephaly often have developmental challenges as they grow older. In some cases, children with microcephaly develop entirely normally. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors such as Down syndrome; exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; and rubella infection during pregnancy.</p>

        					<p>Transmission of Zika virus from pregnant women to their fetuses has been documented.

Zika virus infection close to term could potentially be transmitted during both pregnancy and at childbirth, although this has not been scientifically proven to date.

Pregnant women in general, including those who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection, should see their health-care provider for close monitoring of their pregnancy</p>

        					<p>Whether and when to become pregnant should be a personal decision, on the basis of full information and access to affordable, quality health services.

Women wanting to postpone pregnancy should have access to a comprehensive range of reversible, long- or short-acting contraceptive options. They should also be counselled on the dual protection against sexually transmitted infections provided by condoms.

There are no known safety concerns regarding the use of any hormonal or barrier contraceptive methods for women or adolescent girls at risk of Zika virus, women diagnosed with Zika virus infection, or women and adolescents being treated for Zika virus infection</p>

        				<div class="cd-faq-content">
        					<p>Most women in Zika-affected areas will give birth to normal infants.

Early ultrasound does not reliably predict fetal malformations. WHO recommends a repeat ultrasound of the fetus in the late second or early third trimester (preferably between 28 and 30 weeks) to identify fetal microcephaly and/or other brain abnormalities when they are easier to detect.

Where feasible, screening of amniotic fluid for abnormalities and congenital infections, including Zika virus, is recommended, especially in cases where women test negative for Zika, but their ultrasounds indicate fetal brain abnormalities.

Based on the prognosis of associated fetal brain abnormalities, the woman—and her partner if she wishes—should be offered non-directive counselling so that she, in consultation with her health-care provider, can make a fully informed choice about the next steps in the management of her pregnancy.

Women carrying their pregnancy to term should receive appropriate care and support to manage anxiety, stress and the birth environment. Plans for care and management of the baby soon after birth should be discussed with the parents in consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist where available.

Women who wish to discontinue the pregnancy should receive accurate information about their options to the full extent of the law, including harm reduction where the care desired is not readily available.

Women, whatever their individual choices with respect to their pregnancies, must be treated with respect and dignity.</p>
